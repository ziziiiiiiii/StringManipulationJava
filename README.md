This project was made for CS 112, Fundamentals of Programming 2, at Allan Hancock College. It is written in Java. It manipulates a hardcoded string set within the main function. It reverses the string, replaces all instances of the character '<' with 'e', finds the number of quotes, and finds the number of instances of the word "Nevermore".

The program needs no user input to run. Simply load the program and it will run a demonstration.
